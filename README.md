# CSS Project: Teaching My Brother 😎

I was teaching my brother CSS, and let’s just say... it was an *adventure* 🚀. This is the result of that learning session. 💻✨

**Important Note**: 
DO NOT ask how I made this 😏. It's a secret. If I told you, I’d have to teach you CSS too... and I’m still recovering from the first session 🤯. 

So, just enjoy the styling, and remember: **No questions, just vibes** 😜.

Happy Coding! 👨‍💻💥
